# SWIFT_PORT

## Vision
Build a fully playable, native macOS reinterpretation of Pokemon Red in Swift, using the `pret/pokered` disassembly in this repository as the source of truth for game data, scripted behavior, rules, and content coverage.

The port target is not "run the ROM." The target is:

- a native macOS app with a Swift engine and native UI shell
- deterministic content extracted from the disassembly into tracked runtime artifacts
- a headless, testable simulation core that can be validated independently of rendering
- a telemetry surface that supports focused validation plus high-signal manual-session debugging

## Non-Goals

- No runtime parsing of `.asm` files from the app process
- No ROM-emulator dependency for normal app execution
- No Blue support in Milestones 1-2
- No public distribution assumptions; legal/distribution questions are separate from engineering scope
- No "UI first" implementation that outruns engine and content parity
- No milestone is considered done based only on code presence or compile success

## Governance

- This file is the master engineering ledger for the Swift port.
- Any milestone, PR, or agent task that changes scope, completes work, or uncovers a blocker must update this file in the same change.
- The disassembly remains the canonical gameplay/content source of truth.
- Runtime code must consume extracted artifacts, not ad hoc repo parsing.
- "Done" means implementation plus successful validation against the milestone acceptance criteria.

## Status Legend

- `not started`
- `in progress`
- `blocked`
- `done`

## Current Milestone

### Active Scope

- `M1`: Red extraction foundation
- `M2`: Native macOS boot, splash, title attract, title menu, and telemetry
- `M3`: First playable slice from `New Game` to the first rival battle in Oak's Lab
- `M4A`: Real GB-style field rendering for the current M3 slice

### Current State Summary

Milestones `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, and `M4A` remain complete as of `2026-03-12`.

The repo now contains:

- Tuist manifests
- the planned Swift module layout
- a working Red extraction CLI and committed `Content/Red` artifacts
- a native macOS app that reaches `launch -> splash -> titleAttract -> titleMenu`
- telemetry-backed traces and focused tests for validation and debugging
- a bounded early-M4 progression loop that now reaches `Route 1 -> Viridian City -> Viridian Pokecenter -> Viridian Mart -> Oak parcel return -> Pokedex handoff -> Route 2 -> Viridian Forest corridor` through focused extractor/runtime coverage, with live-session manual validation still required before calling the slice broadly stable
- a source-driven Viridian Pokecenter nurse flow for the current slice, with shared Pokecenter dialogue extracted from the canonical Red text, a native GB-plus yes/no healing prompt, machine animation/SFX plus healed-jingle playback, and field-overlay/telemetry coverage for manual validation
- a centralized current-slice extraction configuration that now expands gameplay/audio/item/encounter coverage together for `REDS_HOUSE_2F`, `REDS_HOUSE_1F`, `PALLET_TOWN`, `ROUTE_1`, `VIRIDIAN_CITY`, `ROUTE_2`, `VIRIDIAN_SCHOOL_HOUSE`, `VIRIDIAN_NICKNAME_HOUSE`, `VIRIDIAN_POKECENTER`, `VIRIDIAN_MART`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST_NORTH_GATE`, and `OAKS_LAB`
- a playable field/dialogue/starter-choice/battle runtime slice from `New Game` through the first rival battle
- source-driven tileset collision metadata and per-map step collision grids for the four-map M3 slice
- source-driven Pallet Town and Oak's Lab map-script triggers and extracted script manifests, with no fallback Swift-only story paths for the slice
- source-driven M3 NPC movement manifests for Pallet Town and Oak's Lab, including actor-aware scripted movement kinds, starter-dependent rival pickup paths, Oak's Pallet escort, and structured idle-wander metadata extracted from map objects
- manifest-backed object interaction reach and conditional trigger contracts now drive NPC/object dialogue and scripts across the current slice, replacing the growing runtime switch tree for Oak Lab, Viridian service NPCs, and interior-map residents
- source-driven trainer battle manifests with extracted enemy parties and starter-dependent rival selection for Oak's Lab plus generic standard-trainer support for `def_trainers` maps
- generic visible item-ball extraction/runtime support for the current slice, including Route 2 and Viridian Forest pickup objects with save-persistent visibility
- extracted starter typings, starter battle sprite paths, copied starter battle assets, and a source-driven type-effectiveness table for Oak Lab battle hardening
- a native overworld/dialogue/battle UI shell for the M3 slice
- real extracted field tilesets, blocksets, and overworld sprite sheets for the M3 slice
- corrected overworld sprite compositing for the accepted M3/M4A slice so sprite color-0 white is treated as transparent instead of multiply-blending against the field background
- Oak Lab rival battle hardening for the accepted M3 slice: battle sprites, queued battle text phases, accuracy/evasion, STAB, type effectiveness, critical hits, Gen 1 physical/special damage splitting, battle-local stat stages for `Attack/Defense/Speed/Special/Accuracy/Evasion`, source-driven trainer move-choice modifications extracted from `data/trainers/move_choices.asm`, and deterministic trainer AI that can prefer useful setup while avoiding capped no-op debuffs
- Oak Lab rival progression for the accepted M3 slice: starter species now carry extracted base-exp and growth-rate data, party Pokemon now persist hidden Gen 1 DVs and per-stat StatExp, the first rival battle grants source-driven trainer EXP plus hidden stat growth, the starter levels up when thresholds are crossed, spawned wild and trainer Pokemon now build their active move sets from extracted Red level-up learnsets with the latest-four-moves rule instead of only species starting moves, battle-driven level-up learnsets now come from extracted Red species data with four-move replacement and HM-forget protection, that progression state persists through native saves, and the party sidebar hover card now shows live current stats plus reusable pill-based move previews with type, PP, power, and accuracy metadata when available
- Oak Lab battle presentation polish for the accepted M3 slice: battles now render inside the shared Game Boy shell without the field LCD shader, battle start now runs a shared GB-inspired intro for trainer and wild encounters with three paced black flashes, a more lingering whole-screen spiral deformation, and a slightly slower simultaneous sprite crossing from the wrong side before the HUD and dialogue fade in together, wild encounter copy now waits for confirm after the reveal instead of auto-advancing, turn presentation now stages one combatant action at a time with the next combatant waiting on confirm instead of auto-chaining immediately after the first action, battle controls/status move into the modern sidebar, move selection now forces the combat accordion open with `Run` rendered as a trailing action row beneath the move list for wild battles, battle sprites honor border-connected white-as-transparent compositing so internal highlights stay opaque, and the in-viewport HUD uses field-style LCD-tinted surfaces with animated HP and EXP bars instead of raw white panels
- trainer battle flow/presentation parity now extends beyond Oak's Lab into the current early-M4 generic-trainer slice: extracted shared Red battle text now drives `wants to fight`, send-out, faint, defeat, payout, and shift-prompt copy; trainer battles start from battle-owned intro taunts instead of a separate field dialogue scene; trainer faceoff/send-out/faint presentation now uses extracted trainer portraits plus player battle sprites with grounded faint poses; wild-appearance, send-out, and player-faint beats now trigger extracted species cries while enemy faint presentation uses source-authentic fall/thud SFX timing; and trainer victories now award source-driven money after the explicit `got ¥... for winning!` beat before post-battle dialogue/scripts resume
- early-M4 inventory/capture foundation now extracts Viridian Mart stock, item prices, Pokeball battle-use metadata, wild-species catch rates, generic Pokemart system text, bounded capture-result text, and visible item-ball pickups from source, opens a native mart overlay from the clerk after Oak receives the parcel, supports `BUY / SELL / QUIT` mart transactions with quantity/confirmation plus unsellable-item and empty-bag handling, exposes a wild-battle bag flow for Pokeballs, resolves bounded Gen 1-style capture math into source-style shake outcomes, supports visible field-item pickup with bag-full rejection and save-persistent object hiding, and persists capture/shop/item-pickup state with schema `6` save compatibility plus telemetry for active shop, capture, and party-selection UI state
- a real GB-style field compositor for M3 maps and actors, with telemetry proving `renderMode == realAssets` and the native field view now presenting those scenes through a tinted Game Boy green treatment, a fixed `160x144` LCD viewport with camera scrolling, and a shader-based DMG LCD treatment with a restrained reflective screen sheen
- connected outdoor map crossings now stay map-scoped in runtime while animating as continuous one-tile steps in presentation, so transitions like `PALLET_TOWN <-> ROUTE_1` no longer visually snap when the active `mapID` changes
- bounded native M3 music playback driven from extracted ASM-backed audio manifests, including title, map-default, scripted override, battle, rival-exit, and Mom-heal routing
- extractor-first native M3 SFX playback driven from the Red disassembly, including source-carried SFX manifests, cue wait/resume policy, current-slice dialogue command extraction from map scripts, move-to-SFX mappings for early battles, and GB-style per-channel music/SFX arbitration so map and battle music can coexist with one-shot effects
- hardened native M3 audio startup/transition behavior so title music is primed before first attract playback, trainer battle music no longer bleeds into the immediate post-battle result dialogue, and extracted pitch slides now carry frame-count timing metadata instead of gliding across the entire note
- audio telemetry that now exposes recent sound-effect ids, playback reasons, revisions, and rejection/preemption outcomes alongside the active music track so focused tests and manual sessions can verify both music transitions and SFX arbitration during the slice
- a native-first single-slot save/load foundation using schema-versioned JSON save envelopes, title-menu `Continue` gating from readable save metadata, in-session sidebar save/load actions, XP-preserving party snapshots with hidden-growth persistence in save schema `5`, backward-compatible defaults for older saves that predate persisted play-time fields, GB-style fresh RNG reseeding on new game/load instead of replaying persisted future encounters, and save telemetry/control endpoints for debugging and focused tests
- a working gameplay sidebar music toggle that now drives runtime audio state directly, stopping active music immediately and resuming the latest requested track when re-enabled instead of rendering a placeholder option row
- battle telemetry that now exposes phase, queued/current text, and move-slot state so the UI, focused tests, and manual sessions can consume turn sequencing directly
- field telemetry that now exposes visible object id, tile position, facing, and idle-vs-scripted movement mode so tests and manual sessions can assert NPC choreography and no-overlap behavior directly
- audio telemetry that now exposes current track, entry, playback reason, and revision so focused tests and manual sessions can validate music transitions during the slice
- save telemetry that now exposes metadata, save/load availability, the last save operation result, and save-store error details so title flow, the gameplay shell, and manual sessions can verify restore behavior explicitly
- session event traces under `.runtime-traces/pokemac/session_events.jsonl` that log script starts/finishes/failures, dialogue starts, warp completions, encounter triggers, battle starts/ends, inventory changes, heals, and save/load outcomes for live debugging
- a unified tile-by-tile movement runner for player and NPC actors, with blocking occupancy checks, scripted movement serialization, bounded idle walking for the current `WALK` NPCs, and animated Oak/Blue movement instead of teleport shortcuts
- a passing validation sweep across the current movement-sensitive module test targets
- a macOS `26.0+` baseline for the Swift port so native Liquid Glass UI can be used without legacy fallback surfaces

The current accepted baseline was revalidated on `2026-03-12` with:

- `./scripts/extract_red.sh`
- `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test -only-testing:PokeExtractCLITests -only-testing:PokeContentTests -only-testing:PokeCoreTests`
- `./scripts/build_app.sh`

Focused manual playthroughs for the refreshed Oak's Lab and Viridian Forest trainer flows are still pending after this validation pass.

### M2 Acceptance Criteria

- a fresh clone can generate the Tuist workspace and build the app locally
- the app launches as a native macOS process from this repo
- the app progresses through `launch -> splash -> titleAttract -> titleMenu`
- the title menu exposes `New Game`, `Continue`, and `Options`
- `Continue` is disabled in M2

- the player can choose a real starter and receive a party Pokemon in-memory
- the rival receives the correct counter-starter
- the first rival battle is playable, grants source-driven EXP to the starter, and resolves into the correct post-battle lab state
- telemetry exposes field, dialogue, starter-choice, battle, party, and event-flag state for the slice
- focused tests and live telemetry cover the slice end to end

## Repo Architecture

### Planned Module Ownership Boundaries

| Module | Ownership Boundary | Responsibilities | Must Not Own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PokeDataModel` | Shared contracts only | Codable manifests, enums, telemetry snapshot models, stable cross-target types | File IO policy, rendering, app lifecycle |
| `PokeExtractCLI` | Source-of-truth extraction | Read disassembly/assets, normalize Red content, write deterministic artifacts, verify extraction outputs | App runtime, UI, scene management |
| `PokeContent` | Runtime loading and validation | Locate content roots, decode manifests, validate content integrity, expose loaded content to runtime | Source repo parsing, game simulation |
| `PokeCore` | Headless simulation | Scene state machine, input handling, timing, menu navigation, future gameplay simulation systems | Platform windowing, AppKit/SwiftUI concerns |
| `PokeRender` | Render pipeline primitives | Field rasterization, sprite/tile decode helpers, screen-space shader/display treatments, render-ready asset contracts | Runtime state ownership, scene routing, shell chrome |
| `PokeUI` | Reusable presentation primitives | Scene composition, title/splash/menu presentation components, gameplay shell chrome, debug overlays, future reusable UI widgets | Business logic, content extraction, low-level render internals |
| `PokeMac` | Native host shell | App lifecycle, windows, commands, menus, keyboard routing, environment/config plumbing | Game rules, extraction logic |
| `PokeTelemetry` | Observability and control | Snapshot publishing, trace output, latest-state access, and debugging-oriented control endpoints | Scene logic, rendering decisions |

### Architectural Rules

- `PokeExtractCLI` is the only module allowed to parse source disassembly files.
- `PokeCore` must remain usable without a macOS UI process.
- `PokeTelemetry` must be stable enough for automated milestone validation.
- Shared schemas must live in `PokeDataModel` before they are consumed across multiple modules.

## Full Game Delivery Ledger

The following table is the top-level full-port checklist. Each row represents a durable subsystem that must reach playable parity for an end-to-end Pokemon Red port.

| Subsystem | Status | Parity Target | Source of Truth | Target Module(s) | Telemetry / Observability | Known Gaps / Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Content extraction pipeline | `in progress` | Deterministic Red extraction covering all runtime content categories | `constants/*.asm`, `data/**`, `engine/**`, `maps/**`, `gfx/**`, `audio/**`, `scripts/**`, `text/**` | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeDataModel` | extractor summaries, deterministic diff checks, verify command output | Title plus bounded M3 gameplay extraction is accepted; expand beyond the first playable slice |
| Runtime content loading | `in progress` | Decode all extracted manifests and fail fast on missing/invalid content | `Content/Red/**` | `PokeContent`, `PokeDataModel` | content load failures, manifest versions, asset lookup failures | Loader now covers gameplay manifests for M3; broaden validation as more content lands |
| Text / charmap / font pipeline | `in progress` | Native text rendering with original charmap semantics and full dialogue support | `constants/charmap.asm`, text sources, font assets | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeContent`, `PokeUI` | charmap coverage checks, missing glyph traces, rendered text snapshots | Title text and bounded M3 dialogue are wired; naming/text edge cases remain |
| Intro / splash / title flow | `done` | Native reproduction of title flow with required transitions and menu logic | `engine/movie/intro.asm`, `engine/movie/title.asm`, `engine/movie/title2.asm`, `gfx/title/**`, `gfx/splash/**` | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeUI`, `PokeMac` | scene state snapshots, menu focus traces, asset load failures | Extend from accepted title flow into gameplay scenes in M3 |
| Save / load / persistence | `in progress` | Usable native-first save system for progression restart, with future adapters for ROM-compatible formats | save format references, WRAM/SRAM behaviors, menu flows | `PokeCore`, `PokeDataModel`, `PokeMac`, `PokeTelemetry` | save slot inventory, metadata, load failures, save/load timing traces | v1 ships as a versioned single-slot native save in Application Support, and schema `6` now persists exact party EXP totals, major status, owned-species progression, current PC box selection, boxed Pokemon, inventory, and early-M4 encounter state while intentionally reseeding field/battle RNG on new game/load to better match GB battery-save behavior; older saves that predate persisted play-time fields now default those values during decode so `Continue` stays available, and raw `.sav` compatibility remains future work |
| Overworld map loading | `in progress` | All maps load with correct tilesets, warps, objects, metadata | `maps/**`, `data/maps/**`, tileset data | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeContent`, `PokeCore`, `PokeUI` | current map id/name, tileset id, warp traces, missing map asset reports | The current slice now loads Pallet, Route 1, Viridian City, Route 2, Viridian Forest South Gate, Viridian Forest, Viridian Forest North Gate, Viridian School House, Viridian Nickname House, Viridian Pokecenter, Viridian Mart, Red's House, and Oak's Lab from one shared extractor configuration, with warps resolved from source destination-warp tiles and parent/outdoor metadata instead of per-map runtime special cases |
| Overworld rendering | `in progress` | Native tile and sprite rendering with deterministic visual composition | map assets, sprite assets, tilesets | `PokeRender`, `PokeUI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeContent` | render surface dimensions, visible map region, sprite layer traces, render mode | Real extracted tile and sprite rendering is accepted for the M3 slice, and the player now uses extracted walking frames plus field-local indoor/outdoor black fades; camera polish and full asset parity remain |
| Player movement and collisions | `in progress` | Correct grid movement, collision, ledges, doors, warps, cut/surf/bike gating | movement/collision logic in disassembly | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeContent`, `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | player position, heading, blocked movement reasons, warp transitions | M3 movement now uses extracted tileset collision metadata, source-resolved warp destinations, black fade transitions for field warps, door-only step-out behavior, blocking occupancy checks against moving actors, and serialized tile-by-tile scripted movement for the four-map slice; broader movement rules and more map coverage remain |
| NPC objects and trainer objects | `in progress` | Correct object spawning, movement, facing, trainer line-of-sight, interactions | object event data, scripts, map data | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | object states, interaction target ids, trainer trigger traces | Lab/Pallet objects still use extracted movement manifests, interactions are now manifest-backed with reach plus ordered conditional triggers, and the current slice now supports standard `def_trainers` maps with extracted trainer metadata, line-of-sight auto-engage, post-battle defeat state, and visible item-ball objects without adding more runtime-only object-id branches; broader NPC schedules and full-map coverage still remain |
| Script engine and event flags | `in progress` | Full script execution and event flag parity | `scripts/**`, event tables, map scripts, flag constants | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | current script id, active flags, script transitions, blocking reasons | Pallet Town and Oak's Lab now run extracted map-script triggers plus actor-aware movement manifests end to end in M3, and the bounded early-M4 parcel/Pokedex loop is now source-driven for Viridian Mart return-to-Oak progression; missing script/dialogue content now fails closed with session-event traces instead of leaving field progression half-blocked |
| Inventory, items, shops, PC | `in progress` | Functional bag, PC storage, marts, item use, hidden items | item data, shop tables, menu scripts | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeUI`, `PokeTelemetry` | bag contents, item actions, mart transactions, storage traces | The current slice now extracts Viridian Mart stock, item prices, generic shop text, and visible item-ball pickups, opens a native `BUY / SELL / QUIT` mart overlay after the parcel handoff with quantity/confirmation plus unsellable-item handling, persists current-box storage state, supports Pokeball capture routing into party-or-box for Route 1 wild battles, and hides picked-up field items through the existing object-visibility save path; broader item effects, hidden items, PC UI, and general menu plumbing still remain |
| Party, stats, moves, evolution | `in progress` | Correct party state, stat growth, level up, learnsets, evolution rules | species/move data, evolution tables | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | party summary, move learn events, evolution triggers, stat deltas | Starter acquisition now seeds hidden Gen 1 DVs and zero StatExp, trainer battles grant hidden stat growth, visible stats recalculate through the Gen 1 formula on creation and level-up, battle-local `speedStage` and `specialStage` now persist through active combat and save/load decoding with neutral backward-compatible defaults, battle-driven level-up learnsets now evaluate extracted Red learnset tables across multi-level gains with four-move replacement prompts and HM-forget protection, and the gameplay sidebar party hover card now surfaces live current stats plus favored/lagging growth coloring derived from hidden DVs and StatExp alongside reusable move preview rows with type, PP, power, and accuracy metadata; evolution still remains |
| Battle engine | `in progress` | Wild, trainer, scripted, and special battle parity | battle engine code, move data, trainer data, effects tables | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeUI`, `PokeTelemetry` | battle state snapshots, turn/action logs, HP/status/EXP deltas | Oak Lab rival battle now applies source-driven type data, accuracy/evasion, STAB, type effectiveness, critical hits, Gen 1 physical/special damage splitting, full one-stage/two-stage stat-effect move handling across `Attack/Defense/Speed/Special/Accuracy/Evasion`, trainer EXP gain, Gen 1-style hidden StatExp rewards with fixed trainer DVs, bounded level-up handling, extracted level-up move learning prompts/replacement flow, source-driven trainer move-choice modifications plus GB-style discouragement-based trainer move selection, and queued turn text, while bounded early-M4 battles now use source-driven encounter tables with shared runtime RNG, support generic standard-trainer encounters with battle-owned intro taunts plus extracted end/after-battle dialogue, trainer shift-style `about to use` prompts, source-driven payout text and money awards, a Pokeball-only battle bag, bounded Gen 1-style capture math into source-style shake outcomes, battle-only stat-stage resets on switch/end, and party-or-box capture routing; broader item effects, full status rules, animations, and special-case trainer systems still remain |
| Battle UI | `in progress` | Native battle presentation, menus, animations, text, outcomes | battle assets, menu text, move/item strings | `PokeUI`, `PokeMac`, `PokeCore` | active combatants, current menu, damage/result events | Oak Lab now renders battles inside the shared Game Boy shell without the field LCD shader, keeps battle text hidden until the shared intro reveal, surfaces move selection and battle status in the modern sidebar, forces the combat accordion open whenever move choice is required, renders wild-battle `Run` as a trailing action row beneath the move list instead of a detached hint, uses the existing party accordion as the switch-selection surface during battle and as the field reorder surface out of battle, uses border-connected white-as-transparent compositing for battle and party Pokemon sprites so internal sprite highlights stay visible, replaces the old intro with a shared three-flash white strobe, whole-screen spiral, and slightly slower simultaneous opposite-side sprite crossing before the HUD and dialogue fade in together, and now gives trainer battles extracted trainer/player faceoff portraits, modernized Pokeball send-out arcs, grounded faint poses, and confirm-gated Red-style send-out/result cadence before returning to move selection; broader item menus, move-specific animations, and broad presentation parity remain |
| Encounters, fishing, gifts, trades, fossils, legendaries | `not started` | Full world content progression parity | encounter tables, map scripts, NPC scripts, gift/trade data | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | encounter source, gift/trade state, one-off content completion flags | Expand extraction beyond core loop data |
| Menus, naming, Pokedex, party UI | `not started` | Full native menu/navigation stack with gameplay parity | menu scripts, text resources, species data | `PokeCore`, `PokeUI`, `PokeMac`, `PokeTelemetry` | current menu stack, selection state, naming input events | Build generic menu framework after title menu is stable |
| Audio / music / SFX | `in progress` | Native playback matching timing and event hooks closely enough for parity | `audio/**`, music/sfx data, track references | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeCore`, `PokeMac`, `PokeTelemetry` | current track ids, entry ids, playback reasons, active/recent sound-effect ids, audio load failures, arbitration outcomes | The current slice now ships extractor-owned music plus SFX manifests, cue wait/resume metadata, script-derived dialogue sound commands, move-to-SFX mappings, battle-lifecycle cries/faint SFX timing, trainer/wild victory music swaps during battle-result flow, battle level-up SFX timing on the `grew to Lv…` dialogue beat, corrected GB SFX waveform mapping for channels `5/6/7/8` so cues like level-up render on square/square/wave/noise instead of collapsing to noise, per-channel music/SFX arbitration, and sound-effect telemetry for blocked movement, door/stair warps, confirms, item jingles, rival-battle moves, battle send-out/faint beats, and the Viridian Pokecenter healing machine plus healed jingle; broader ROM coverage, higher-fidelity envelopes, and additional source hooks still remain |
| Native macOS shell and UX | `in progress` | Native menus, settings, scaling, input mapping, window behavior, accessibility basics | app-level design decisions and extracted content constraints | `PokeMac`, `PokeUI`, `PokeTelemetry` | window scale, focused scene, input bindings, command usage | Title-shell scope is accepted; the gameplay sidebar now owns a working music on/off control wired into runtime audio state, while broader settings and accessibility work remain for later milestones |
| Telemetry, debug tooling, parity traces | `in progress` | Stable state snapshots, control hooks, regression traces, parity/debug surfaces | runtime state plus extracted content metadata | `PokeTelemetry`, `PokeCore` | JSONL traces, session event traces, latest snapshot endpoint, debug overlay | Early-M4 validation relies on focused extractor/runtime tests plus live `telemetry.jsonl` and `session_events.jsonl` traces during manual sessions; session events explicitly surface script failures from missing extracted content so stalled progression can be diagnosed from a single playthrough |

| Bounded M3 audio manifest | optional | `in progress` | `constants/music_constants.asm`, `audio/headers/musicheaders*.asm`, `data/maps/songs.asm`, selected `audio/music/*.asm`, `audio/wave_samples.asm` | `audio_manifest.json` | `PokeExtractCLI` | The bounded manifest now covers the early-M4 corridor through Viridian Forest map routes and cues; expand coverage and fidelity beyond the current slice |
| Maps | no | `in progress` | `maps/**`, `data/maps/**` | `gameplay_manifest.json` map section | `PokeExtractCLI` | The current slice now extends through Route 2 and the Viridian Forest corridor; continue expanding map/script coverage slice by slice |
| Tilesets / blocksets / overworld sprites | no | `in progress` | `gfx/tilesets/**`, `gfx/blocksets/**`, `gfx/sprites/**` | `gameplay_manifest.json` tileset/sprite sections, collision metadata, and copied field assets | `PokeExtractCLI` | Current slice assets and collision metadata now cover the Viridian Forest corridor, including `FOREST` and `FOREST_GATE`; expand coverage beyond the current slice |
| Species / moves / items | no | `in progress` | `data/pokemon/**`, `data/moves/**`, `data/items/**` | `gameplay_manifest.json` species/moves sections | `PokeExtractCLI` | Gameplay extraction now covers the canonical 151 species, full Red move catalog, source-driven battle sprite paths, and extracted level-up learnsets; evolution tables and broader item/catalog consumers still need follow-through |
| Scripts / events / flags | no | `in progress` | `scripts/**`, event constants | `gameplay_manifest.json` script/event sections | `PokeExtractCLI` | Grow the bounded IR only as the next slice requires |
| Battle data | no | `in progress` | battle engine data, trainer/move tables | `gameplay_manifest.json` trainer battle section | `PokeExtractCLI` | Trainer parties, standard-trainer header metadata, starter battle assets, and the type-effectiveness table are source-driven for Oak Lab plus the Viridian Forest corridor; add broader trainer and wild battle coverage after the current slice |

## Gameplay Parity Matrix

| Gameplay Area | Parity Goal | Status | Blocking Dependencies | Telemetry Needed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boot and scene progression | Native app reaches title menu reliably | `done` | content loader, title assets, runtime state machine | current scene, scene timestamps, failures | Accepted in focused tests and live app verification |
| Title menu input | Directional navigation and confirm/cancel/start | `done` | runtime input mapping, app key routing | recent input events, focused entry, disabled states | `Continue` is now runtime-resolved from save availability; the no-save disabled path was validated in M2 and is preserved |
| Placeholder routing | Explicit non-silent routing for unavailable paths | `done` | scene state machine, placeholder view | active placeholder id/reason | `New Game` and `Options` route to placeholders in M2 |
| Overworld movement | Full field control and collisions | `in progress` | maps, object data, collision rules, renderer | map id, position, heading, blocked reasons | Bounded four-map slice is live in M3 and now uses extracted collision metadata, exact destination-warp spawning, and door-only step-out semantics instead of manual blocked-tile and warp-offset logic |
| NPC interaction | Correct interaction and script triggering | `in progress` | objects, scripts, text engine | target object id, script id, dialogue state | NPC interaction dispatch is now manifest-backed for the current slice, including Oak, Mom, starter balls, Viridian service NPCs, and the School House/Nickname House residents, while hidden-object/predef interactions and broader world coverage still remain |
| Story progression | Event flag and scripted sequence parity | `in progress` | event flags, script runner, map triggers | active flags, story milestones, last trigger | First playable story slice is accepted in M3 and its Pallet/Oak/Lab trigger flow is now source-driven within the fixed four-map boundary |
| Battles | Correct outcomes and flow | `in progress` | species/move/trainer data, battle engine, UI | battle snapshots, turn logs, HP/status, rewards | The first rival battle now has materially better correctness inside the accepted M3 slice, including source-driven typings/sprites, queued text sequencing, and bounded Gen 1 damage rules; overall combat still remains slice-bounded rather than full Red parity |
| Save/load | Persistent progression | `in progress` | save schema, runtime serialization, UI | slot metadata, save result, load result | Native-first single-slot save/load is live for the current slice, now on save schema `7` with persisted blackout checkpoints; raw `.sav` compatibility and broader progression data remain future work |
| End-to-end full game | Start to credits fully playable | `not started` | every major subsystem | milestone dashboard plus parity checkpoints | Final target |

## Platform / Native UX Matrix

| UX Area | Target | Status | Owner | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native macOS app target | App launches from repo without ROM dependency | `in progress` | `PokeMac` | build + launch scripts |
| Native menu bar integration | basic app commands and dev/debug entry points | `in progress` | `PokeMac` | app command tests and manual validation |
| Integer scaling | nearest-neighbor pixel presentation | `in progress` | `PokeUI` | render smoke test and telemetry surface info |
| Keyboard mapping | directional, confirm, cancel, start | `in progress` | `PokeMac`, `PokeCore` | focused tests and live app validation |

| Settings / Options shell | native host for future options | `not started` | `PokeMac`, `PokeUI` | route placeholder exists in M2 |
| Save slots UI | single-slot native save management with title `Continue` and in-session restore affordances | `in progress` | `PokeMac`, `PokeUI`, `PokeCore` | save/load acceptance and restore validation |
| Accessibility basics | readable text, focus order, scaling policy | `not started` | `PokeUI`, `PokeMac` | future accessibility checklist |

## Telemetry and Agentic Validation Matrix

The M1/M2 contract requires telemetry that is stable enough for repeated build-launch-drive-verify loops.

| Capability | Target | Status | Surface | Owner | Acceptance Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latest runtime snapshot | machine-readable current state | `done` | JSON endpoint and JSONL trace | `PokeTelemetry` | used by targeted tests and manual debugging |
| Scene identity | `launch`, `splash`, `titleAttract`, `titleMenu`, placeholder substates | `done` | runtime snapshot | `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | validated through end-to-end loop |
| Menu telemetry | menu entries, focus index, disabled state | `done` | runtime snapshot | `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | validated through synthetic input flow |
| Input event telemetry | recent synthetic and real inputs | `done` | runtime snapshot / trace | `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | confirmed during smoke validation and manual debugging |
| Content / asset failures | load failures are visible, not silent | `done` | runtime snapshot / trace | `PokeContent`, `PokeTelemetry` | surfaced in snapshot contract |
| Session event log | high-signal story/runtime trace for live sessions | `done` | `session_events.jsonl` | `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | primary debugging surface for early-M4 manual playtesting |
| Render/window state | scale and render dimensions | `done` | runtime snapshot | `PokeMac`, `PokeTelemetry` | exposed in M2 telemetry contract |
| Field render mode | field scenes prove placeholder vs real extracted assets | `done` | runtime snapshot / trace | `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry`, `PokeUI` | `renderMode == realAssets` is validated through the M3/M4A loop, with transition telemetry now distinguishing indoor/outdoor door fades from immediate stair warps |
| Build command | one stable app build command | `done` | repo script | `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeMac` | used in routine development |
| Launch command | one stable app launch command | `done` | repo script | `PokeMac` | used in routine development |
| Save/load control surface | native save, in-session load, and relaunch `Continue` behavior are externally observable and driveable | `done` | runtime snapshot plus `/save` and `/load` control endpoints | `PokeCore`, `PokeTelemetry` | used by focused tests and manual-session debugging |

### Telemetry Contract for M2

M2 must expose, at minimum:

- app version
- content manifest version
- active scene
- active substate or placeholder reason when applicable
- title menu entries
- focused menu index
- disabled entry states
- recent input events
- asset/content loading failures
- window scale
- render surface dimensions

### Agentic Validation Contract for M2

The project must support the following repeatable loop:

1. build the required targets
2. regenerate or verify extracted Red content
3. launch the native app
4. poll latest telemetry
5. drive synthetic input
6. verify state transitions and UI state through telemetry
7. stop the app cleanly
8. repeat until the milestone acceptance criteria pass

## Testing and Validation Matrix

| Validation Area | Required for M1 | Required for M2 | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| extractor unit tests | yes | no | `done` | `PokeExtractCLITests` passes |
| manifest fixture tests | yes | yes | `in progress` | explicit snapshot-style fixtures are still worth adding |
| extraction determinism check | yes | yes | `done` | two temp-root extraction runs produced no diff on `2026-03-09` |
| content loader tests | yes | yes | `done` | `PokeContentTests` passes |

| build and launch script tests | no | yes | `done` | build/launch flows remain exercised through routine development commands |
| render smoke test | no | yes | `done` | app boots with extracted assets and zero asset-loading failures in validation |
| ROM build non-regression | yes | no | `not started` | keep existing pokered build path intact if applicable |

## Milestone 1 Detailed Scope

### Inputs

- `constants/charmap.asm`
- `engine/movie/intro.asm`
- `engine/movie/title.asm`
- `engine/movie/title2.asm`
- `gfx/title/**`
- `gfx/splash/**`
- `gfx/font/**`
- title-relevant constants from `constants/*.asm`

### Expected Outputs

- `Content/Red/game_manifest.json`
- `Content/Red/constants.json`
- `Content/Red/charmap.json`
- `Content/Red/title_manifest.json`
- `Content/Red/audio_manifest.json` if identifiers are stubbed early
- normalized runtime asset tree for title, splash, and font assets

### Public Contracts to Freeze

- `GameVariant`
- `GameManifest`
- `CharmapManifest`
- `TitleSceneManifest`
- `ContentLoader`
- `RuntimeTelemetrySnapshot`
- `TelemetryPublisher`

## Milestone 2 Detailed Scope

### Scene States

- `launch`
- `splash`
- `titleAttract`
- `titleMenu`
- explicit placeholder states for unavailable routes

### Required Behavior

- native macOS window and host shell
- integer-scaled pixel content
- native keyboard input routing
- title menu with `New Game`, `Continue`, `Options`
- `Continue` enabled only when a valid native save exists
- explicit placeholder destinations for unavailable actions
- lightweight debug surface
- telemetry stable enough for debugging and focused validation

## Open Risks

- The exact extracted schema surface can drift if multiple agents add fields without freezing `PokeDataModel` first.
- Title flow implementation can appear complete while still lacking deterministic telemetry, which would block true milestone acceptance.
- Asset path conventions can drift between extractor output and runtime loading unless the runtime-facing layout is explicitly frozen.
- The native-first save format is now real, so any future ROM-compatible or dual-format adapter must preserve schema-versioned restores, title `Continue` gating, and intro-smoke compatibility instead of bypassing them.
- Script/event extraction will likely become the highest-complexity subsystem after M2 and should not be improvised ad hoc.
- Battle implementation risk is high if battle data contracts are not separated cleanly from UI concerns.

## Blockers

- None formally declared yet.

When a blocker is discovered, add:

- blocker description
- owner
- date discovered
- impacted milestone
- temporary mitigation
- unblock condition

## Deferred Decisions

- Whether to add ROM-compatible or dual-format save adapters on top of the native primary save format
- Remaining audio fidelity/parity strategy beyond the bounded native M3 playback implementation
- How much title/intro timing should be driven directly by extracted manifests versus native reinterpretation layers
- When to introduce Blue support after Red reaches stable parity milestones
- Long-term parity strategy against original runtime behavior beyond milestone-local smoke tests

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Scope `M4` around the next early-game progression slice beyond the Viridian Forest corridor now that standard trainer maps and visible item balls are source-driven.
2. Expand the bounded script and content coverage carefully, keeping bespoke/non-standard trainer scripts separate from the new generic trainer-map path.
3. Keep broad validation focused on extractor/runtime tests and live session traces for M4 work.
4. Add explicit manifest fixture snapshots as extraction coverage expands.
5. Keep this ledger current as milestone scope and acceptance evidence change.

## Progress Log

### 2026-03-11

- Added a persisted gameplay `Appearance` toggle backed by app settings, cycling `System`, `Dark`, and `Light` from the live sidebar `Options` section with `System` as the default, and re-themed the shared title/gameplay/battle chrome around semantic palette tokens so presentation can switch globally without touching save data or extracted content.
- Added a retro-charcoal dark presentation pass for the shared Game Boy shell, including a restrained phosphor-style green LCD glow around the gameplay/battle screen well while keeping the existing field filter and screen shaders independent from the new appearance toggle.
- Reworked the dark gameplay shell away from the earlier charcoal pass toward a black-hardware variant with a stronger glow-in-the-dark green halo concentrated around the LCD well, keeping the non-gameplay shell locked to the light presentation.
- Flattened the gameplay-shell backdrop to a solid fill and pushed the dark-mode phosphor effect further outward from the LCD so the glow reads around the screen instead of across the full background.
- Removed the remaining LCD reflection gradients and bezel-centered glow bias so the dark-mode phosphor effect now hugs the active screen area itself instead of tinting the surrounding shell.
- Replaced the clipped LCD halo with a softer screen-edge bloom and removed the green dark-mode rim so the phosphor effect now feathers just outside the active display without reading like a hard border.
- Dropped the extra dark-mode shell stroke around the LCD so the rounded viewport itself defines the screen edge without a mismatched border radius.
- Softened the dark-mode LCD bloom slightly after the visibility pass so the glow still feathers outside the screen without overpowering the shell.
- Restored the tinted LCD reflection band in the field shader for the stylized DMG preset while leaving the authentic preset path unchanged.
- Removed the remaining LCD outline strokes in both the shared shell and field viewport overlays so light and dark gameplay rely on the clipped screen shape instead of an extra border.
- Promoted gameplay HDR from a dark-only prototype into a persisted `HDR Effects` option, with shared light/dark tuning profiles that keep the window SDR while driving only the LCD glow, screen content, and battery LED through the macOS 26 EDR path when the display supports it.
- Persisted the gameplay music toggle through the app settings store/coordinator path so audio starts in the user's last chosen state and the sidebar switch updates both runtime playback and stored preference together.
- Refactored app-wide settings ownership into an environment-injected `AppPreferences` observable so SwiftUI scenes mutate appearance, HDR, and music directly without threading settings closures through the runtime router and gameplay props factory.
- Removed the full-screen pixel-grid overlay from `GameBoyScreen` so gameplay and title surfaces read cleaner while keeping the shared Game Boy shell layout intact.
- Reworked the gameplay host/sidebar chrome toward native macOS 26 Liquid Glass, using shared sidebar card/inset/chip surface primitives with retro-tinted materials instead of repeated hardcoded fills.
- Split the monolithic gameplay sidebar view into focused field, battle, trainer, party, inventory/save/options, and shared-primitives files so future native UI iterations can stay scoped without changing gameplay/sidebar behavior contracts.
- Refined the in-battle viewport chrome with a battle-only pixel-grid shader, pixel-font HUD/sidebar labels, and softer Liquid Glass foe/player status cards so the combat UI feels closer to the modern field shell without changing battle behavior.
- Added battle-sidebar attention chrome so the blocking accordion card now brightens with a soft glow while move choice, trainer shift confirmation, learn-move prompts, or party switch selection are waiting on sidebar input.
- Narrowed the old intro/M3 smoke validator back to the accepted boundary before later retiring it, and removed the abandoned early-M4 scripted validator plus its external RNG debug endpoint.
- Added runtime session-event tracing for scripts, dialogue, warps, encounters, battles, inventory changes, heals, and save/load outcomes, written to `.runtime-traces/pokemac/session_events.jsonl` for manual session debugging.
- Updated `./scripts/launch_app.sh` with an interactive Rich-backed live-watch mode that keeps the launch script attached, tails fresh `session_events.jsonl` entries, polls `/telemetry/latest`, and quits the app cleanly on `Ctrl-C` for manual debugging sessions.
- Added focused extractor/runtime/telemetry coverage for the early-M4 slice so Route 1, Viridian, encounters, healing, and parcel/Pokedex state can be validated without relying on a brittle long autoplay flow.
- Extended the extracted field map contract with source-driven connection strips so maps can render adjacent-map border data instead of repeating the local border block everywhere outside bounds.
- Updated field background composition and the field debug map to resolve out-of-bounds blocks through GB-style north/south/west/east connection offsets before falling back to the map border block.
- Added connection-focused extractor and renderer coverage so padded field rendering stays aligned with the original map-header semantics as the playable map set expands.
- Fixed connected outdoor border presentation so crossing an extracted map connection animates like a normal step instead of snapping when the active map changes.
- Centralized current-slice gameplay extraction in shared slice configuration so map/audio/item/encounter expansion stays aligned as early-M4 coverage grows.
- Replaced the hardcoded runtime object-interaction switch with manifest-backed interaction reach and ordered conditional triggers, and used that path to add Viridian School House and Viridian Nickname House maps plus their resident NPC dialogue coverage.

### 2026-03-12

- Added generic standard-trainer extraction/runtime support for `def_trainers` maps, including parsed trainer headers, `TalkToTrainer` text bindings, extracted trainer parties for slice-referenced non-story trainers, line-of-sight auto-engage, post-battle dialogue routing, and manifest-owned post-battle continuation so Oak's Lab rival flow no longer relies on a hardcoded runtime branch.
- Added generic visible item-ball extraction/runtime support, wiring `PickUpItemText` object metadata into extracted pickup item ids, native bag-full rejection, extracted found-item dialogue generation, item-jingle playback, and save-persistent object hiding for Route 2 and Viridian Forest pickup objects.
- Expanded the early-M4 slice through `ROUTE_2`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST`, and `VIRIDIAN_FOREST_NORTH_GATE`, including extracted `FOREST` / `FOREST_GATE` tilesets, Route 2 and Viridian Forest wild encounters, Viridian Forest trainer objects/signs, and corridor audio map routes.
- Fixed a catastrophic-backtracking extractor regression in trainer text parsing by replacing the broad `TalkToTrainer` regex with a bounded line parser, which unblocked deterministic `PokeExtractCLI extract` runs for the expanded slice.
- Fixed a Viridian Forest South Gate collision regression by resolving per-tileset blockset sources from extracted tileset metadata instead of a stale hardcoded switch, which restored the interior aisle and warp approach between Viridian City and the forest.
- Fixed a `Continue` regression for newly added map objects by merging saved object state over current content defaults during load, which restores Viridian Forest trainer line-of-sight auto-engage for older saves that predate the forest object roster.
- Fixed visible item-ball duplication for older saves by materializing missing runtime object state from manifest defaults before pickup and object-visibility mutations, which makes newly added pickups like the Viridian Forest antidote disappear correctly after collection.
- Added GB-style standard trainer encounter presentation for generic `def_trainers` maps, including source-driven male/female/evil encounter music extraction, trainer-battle cue selection on both LOS and manual talk, a transient field `!` overlay during trainer sighting, and LOS sequencing that now matches Red's encounter-music -> alert -> walk-up -> intro dialogue flow before battle music takes over.
- Refined trainer battle parity for Oak's Lab rival and current-slice `def_trainers` encounters by extracting shared Red battle text templates plus trainer reward/sprite metadata, moving trainer taunts into the battle-owned intro flow, adding Red-style `wants to fight` / send-out / faint / shift / payout message cadence, awarding money only after the explicit payout beat resolves, and upgrading trainer presentation with faceoff portraits, Pokeball send-out arcs, and grounded fainted sprites.
- Changed scheduled battle presentation beats so combat actions now flow in a more GB-like cadence: selecting a move immediately runs the `used MOVE!` windup, animation, and next combatant/action batch without an extra confirm gate, and trainer `about to use` prompts now transition straight into the sidebar `YES/NO` decision when the question page appears, while follow-up result, EXP, level-up, trainer prompt intro pages, capture, payout, and other paginated battle text still pauses for `A`.
- Revalidated the expanded early-M4 slice with `./scripts/extract_red.sh` and `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test -only-testing:PokeExtractCLITests -only-testing:PokeContentTests -only-testing:PokeCoreTests`.

- Extracted the low-level field render pipeline out of `PokeUI` into a new internal `PokeRender` target, moving field rasterization, pixel-asset decode/mask/cache, and screen-space shader resources behind a render-only module boundary while keeping gameplay shells, battle/field scene composition, and title UI in `PokeUI`.
- Added shared `FieldRenderableObjectState` to `PokeDataModel` so `PokeRender` consumes render-ready DTOs instead of `PokeCore` runtime types, and updated `GameRuntime` plus the gameplay host to project/runtime-adapt those DTOs at the module edge.

### 2026-03-10

- Kept M3 coverage fixed to `REDS_HOUSE_2F`, `REDS_HOUSE_1F`, `PALLET_TOWN`, and `OAKS_LAB` while removing remaining manual runtime glue inside that slice.
- Replaced hardcoded blocked-tile logic with extracted tileset collision metadata and per-map resolved step collision grids consumed by `PokeContent` and `PokeCore`.
- Replaced fallback Pallet Town and Oak's Lab script paths with extracted map-script triggers and script manifests, including the Pallet north-exit Oak intro and Oak's Lab starter/rival flow.
- Expanded trainer battle extraction/runtime contracts from single-enemy assumptions to source-driven trainer parties and starter-dependent rival resolution.
- Replaced the stub audio contract with bounded ASM-driven M3 music extraction, including track metadata, map music routing, scripted cues, and the rival alternate-start entrypoint.
- Added native runtime music ownership and playback for the M3 slice, with title, map-default, scripted override, battle, rival-exit, and Mom-heal transitions driven from extracted content.
- Extended telemetry and validation coverage to assert audio track, reason, and entry transitions during the M3 end-to-end flow.
- Tightened extractor timing fidelity for the bounded music slice by matching the engine's carried note-delay behavior more closely.
- Extended telemetry to surface active map-script triggers and enemy party progress so tools and tests can validate the source-driven runtime path directly.
- Updated the field renderer/view baseline so gameplay maps default to the tinted Game Boy presentation, while preserving raw grayscale composition internally and existing `renderMode == realAssets` telemetry semantics.
- Corrected two Oak/Blue choreography parity gaps in the accepted M3 slice: simulated joypad escort paths now execute in the same order as the GB engine, and Blue's counter-starter ball stays visible until his post-walk pickup dialogue reaches the original hide point.
- Replaced the cached pixel-matrix overlay with a shader-based LCD treatment in the field view so DMG palette remap, pixel-cell shaping, and a restrained reflective glass sheen all live in a single display-only pass.
- Added a working field-filter switcher in the gameplay sidebar options section so the UI can swap between authentic DMG, tinted, and raw grayscale field presentation without touching runtime state contracts.
- Optimized field presentation updates so the SwiftUI field view no longer regenerates the full scene bitmap during ordinary body invalidations, and the renderer now caches decoded assets plus recent rendered frames by render signature.
- Narrowed the gameplay scene props path so the SwiftUI gameplay shell now consumes dedicated field/battle scene-state projections from `GameRuntime` instead of rebuilding a full telemetry snapshot for every gameplay recompute, while keeping telemetry/debug surfaces on `RuntimeTelemetrySnapshot`.
- Reworked gameplay field presentation around a fixed `160x144` Game Boy LCD viewport with a scrolling camera, layered actor composition, border-block padding at map edges, and a DMG-style screen well that keeps interiors and exteriors at the same logical gameplay scale.
- Replaced the last hand-authored M3 warp offset table with source-driven destination-warp resolution, so doors now place the player on the actual destination doorway tile and stairs land directly on their stair tile.
- Added extracted player walking frames for compatible `16x96` overworld sprite sheets and wired the native field view to use the source-style four-phase `stand, walk, stand, walk` cadence during manual movement, scripted movement, and automatic door step-out, including the mirrored second walking pose for vertical steps.
- Normal field movement now paces both repeated key input and the visible walk cycle to the step cadence instead of accepting macOS key-repeat bursts mid-step, removing the acceleration feel during sustained directional movement.
- The macOS field input bridge now watches when the runtime can accept the next directional step instead of sleeping a whole extra repeat interval, so held movement and direction changes chain without the added standing pause between steps, and the field walk-cycle presentation now carries the visible stride frame into same-direction chained steps instead of briefly resetting to a sliding standing pose at each tile boundary; the rendered field view also drives walk-frame sampling with an explicit minimum animation interval so outdoor camera scrolling does not skip the short leg-frame windows, and object-only NPC movement refreshes now preserve any still-active player step animation instead of clearing the leg cadence mid-stride.
- Added runtime-owned field transition sequencing with a field-local DMG-style black fade-out/fade-in for both door and stair warps, while keeping automatic step-out limited to destination door tiles, plus explicit field transition telemetry for tools and tests.
- Added a native-first save/load foundation with schema-versioned JSON envelopes, a primary save file under Application Support (or `POKESWIFT_SAVE_ROOT` in tool-driven runs), title-menu `Continue` restore, sidebar save/load actions with confirmation, and save telemetry surfaced through `RuntimeTelemetrySnapshot`.
- Extended milestone validation and tests to cover post-battle save, relaunch, and `Continue` restore into the Oak's Lab post-rival state, and added focused `PokeCoreTests` coverage for save/restore plus unreadable-save handling.
- Raised the player's battle HUD/platform/sprite row inside the shared Game Boy battle shell so the in-viewport presentation sits correctly after the gameplay-shell migration.
- Revalidated the accepted M3/M4A baseline with `./scripts/extract_red.sh` and `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test`.

### 2026-03-09

- Created `SWIFT_PORT.md` as the master full-port ledger for the Swift Pokemon Red project.
- Captured the full end-to-end delivery scope required for a playable native macOS port.
- Recorded module boundaries for `PokeDataModel`, `PokeExtractCLI`, `PokeContent`, `PokeCore`, `PokeUI`, `PokeMac`, and `PokeTelemetry`.
- Marked `M1` and `M2` as `in progress` based on current repo scaffolding, without promoting them to done before end-to-end validation.

- Established the rule that this file must be updated whenever implementation status, scope, or blockers change.
- Accepted `M1` after successful extractor build, `extract`, `verify`, and deterministic diff validation.
- Accepted `M2` after real-app validation completed successfully.
- Ran `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test` successfully to verify the current workspace test suite.
- Raised the Swift port deployment target from macOS `15.0` to macOS `26.0` so title/menu surfaces can use native Liquid Glass directly.
- Reworked the title menu and placeholder surfaces around native Liquid Glass panels and rows to fix low-contrast white-on-white menu presentation.
- Accepted `M3` after the real app validator completed the slice from `New Game` through the first rival battle and returned to the post-battle lab state.
- Added `gameplay_manifest.json` and the bounded M3 extraction/runtime contracts for four maps, slice-specific scripts, dialogue, starter data, and the first rival battle.
- Expanded the telemetry and validation loop to cover field, dialogue, starter-choice, battle, party, and event-flag state end to end.
- Verified deterministic M3 extraction with two temporary output roots and a clean `diff -ru`.
- Accepted `M4A` after replacing placeholder field rendering with a real GB-style compositor driven by extracted tilesets, blocksets, and overworld sprite sheets for the M3 slice.
- Added tileset and overworld sprite manifests to `gameplay_manifest.json`, copied field assets into `Content/Red/Assets/field`, and validated that field scenes report `renderMode == realAssets` with zero asset-loading failures.
- Verified M4A with `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test`.
