# SWIFT_PORT

## Goal
- Build a fully playable, native macOS reinterpretation of Pokemon Red in Swift.
- Treat `pret/pokered` as the gameplay and content source of truth.
- Keep runtime code consuming extracted `Content/Red/**` artifacts, never source `.asm` files directly.
- Treat this file as the current ledger for shipped scope, remaining parity gaps, and milestone order.

## Non-Negotiables
- `PokeExtractCLI` is the only module that parses source assets or disassembly.
- `PokeCore` stays headless and testable.
- `PokeUI` and `PokeMac` present native SwiftUI/AppKit shells instead of emulator UI shortcuts.
- A milestone is only `done` when the intended slice is implemented and validated.

## Ownership
- `PokeExtractCLI`: extraction, normalization, deterministic runtime artifacts.
- `PokeContent`: loading and validation of extracted content.
- `PokeDataModel`: shared manifest, save, and telemetry schemas.
- `PokeCore`: gameplay simulation, progression, battle, scripts, persistence.
- `PokeRender` + `PokeUI`: field/battle rendering and native presentation.
- `PokeMac` + `PokeTelemetry`: host shell, audio/save wiring, debug/control surfaces.

## Status Model
- `done`: implemented and validated for the intended scope.
- `bounded`: real implementation exists, but it is still current-slice-only or missing Red-wide generalization.
- `missing`: no meaningful implementation yet.

## Current Baseline
- Milestones `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, and `M4` are done.
- The current validated playable slice is:
  `New Game -> Red's House -> Pallet Town -> Oak intro -> Oak's Lab starter choice -> first rival battle -> Route 1 -> Viridian City -> Viridian Pokecenter -> Viridian Mart parcel -> Oak parcel handoff + Pokedex -> Route 2 -> Viridian Forest corridor`.
- The currently extracted map set is:
  `REDS_HOUSE_2F`, `REDS_HOUSE_1F`, `PALLET_TOWN`, `ROUTE_1`, `VIRIDIAN_CITY`, `ROUTE_2`, `VIRIDIAN_SCHOOL_HOUSE`, `VIRIDIAN_NICKNAME_HOUSE`, `VIRIDIAN_POKECENTER`, `VIRIDIAN_MART`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST_NORTH_GATE`, `OAKS_LAB`, `PEWTER_CITY`, `PEWTER_POKECENTER`, `PEWTER_MART`, `PEWTER_NIDORAN_HOUSE`, `PEWTER_SPEECH_HOUSE`, `MUSEUM_1F`, `MUSEUM_2F`, `PEWTER_GYM`, `ROUTE_3`.
- The current save schema is `8`.
- The repo already has real native implementations for starter/capture naming, Pokedex browsing with persisted encounter counts, trainer/party/bag/save/options sidebars, marts, Pokecenter healing, capture, boxed overflow, blackout recovery, and telemetry-backed save/load.

## Validation Sources

## System Ledger
| System | State | Shipped Now | Remaining For Full Red Parity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extraction pipeline | `bounded` | `RedContentExtractor` now regenerates an M5-ready 23-map content set, including source-driven maps, marts, items, trainer battles, event flags, and audio routes through Pewter, Museum, and `ROUTE_3`, alongside `game_manifest.json`, `constants.json`, `charmap.json`, `title_manifest.json`, `gameplay_manifest.json`, `audio_manifest.json`, and copied title/field/battle assets. | Keep extending source-driven coverage beyond the M5 support set and avoid reintroducing hard-coded map, trainer, or audio slices. |
| Gameplay content schema | `bounded` | `GameplayManifest` already covers maps, tilesets, sprites, dialogues, field interactions, scripts, items, marts, species, moves, type chart, wild encounters, trainer AI mods, trainer battles, battle text, player start, and source-driven species evolution triggers plus evolution dialogue/audio hooks. | Expand beyond the landed level-evolution slice with trade/item evolution requirements, cancel flow variants, gifts, trades, hidden items, fishing, fossils, legendaries, and other one-off progression systems. |
| Species, moves, and Pokedex data | `done` | Full-catalog species and move extraction is already in place, including catch rates, growth rates, learnsets, cries, battle sprites, dex number, category, size, entry text, and persisted per-species encounter counts surfaced in the native Pokedex. | Keep schemas stable as more systems consume the data. |
| Maps, tilesets, and field assets | `bounded` | The source-driven field asset path now covers the early corridor plus `PEWTER_CITY`, Pewter interiors, `MUSEUM_1F`, `MUSEUM_2F`, `PEWTER_GYM`, and `ROUTE_3`, with real tilesets, blocksets, collision grids, warps, map connections, objects, and rendered field assets. | Expand beyond the current M5-ready map set and keep map special cases out of runtime switches. |
| Field traversal and world logic | `bounded` | The runtime already supports connections, warps, doors, stairs, collisions, ledges, idle NPC walking, scripted movement, trainer LOS, object visibility, and visible pickups. | Add Red-wide traversal rules and blockers for `Cut`, `Surf`, `Strength`, `Flash`, bike gates, water travel, and late-game map mechanics. |
| Script engine and progression flags | `bounded` | Script execution already handles map triggers, dialogues, battles, movement, flags, inventory mutations, music cues, object mutations, parcel return, Pokedex handoff, and Pokecenter healing. | Generalize to broader story arcs, gifts, trades, fossils, Safari flows, legendary events, and late-game gates. |
| Encounters and capture | `bounded` | Grass encounters work for `ROUTE_1`, `ROUTE_2`, `VIRIDIAN_FOREST`, and `ROUTE_3`; capture uses source-style shake buckets, routes new Pokemon to party or current box, and feeds persisted encounter counts into the Pokedex lane. | Add water encounters, fishing, Safari encounters, static/story encounters, and broader trainer battle coverage. |
| Battle engine and progression | `bounded` | Trainer and wild battles already cover core damage, type effectiveness, stat stages, trainer AI shaping, EXP, StatExp, level-up learn prompts, payout, blackout, post-battle continuation, post-reward level evolution, major/volatile status handling, and the current GB-backed multi-turn/copy move families including Counter, Haze, Pay Day, Conversion, Bide, Thrash/Petal Dance, Teleport/forced escape, trapping, charge/Fly, Transform, Substitute, Rage, Mimic, Mirror Move, and Metronome. | Add battle items, badge/TM reward consequences, non-level evolutions, broader special battles, Red-wide trainer special cases, and deeper edge-case/manual-session parity coverage for the newly landed move families. |
| Inventory, marts, storage, persistence | `bounded` | Viridian and Pewter Mart buy/sell/quit contracts now load from extracted mart manifests, visible items persist, the item catalog generalizes from source constants instead of a hand-picked slice, capture can overflow to boxes, and schema `8` save/load persists party, boxes, flags, blackout checkpoints, inventory, owned/seen species, and species encounter counts. | Add general item use, PC deposit/withdraw/release/change-box flows, hidden items, and broader quest-item handling. |
| Inventory, marts, storage, persistence | `bounded` | Viridian and Pewter Mart buy/sell/quit contracts now load from extracted mart manifests, visible items persist, the item catalog generalizes from source constants instead of a hand-picked slice, capture can overflow to boxes, and schema `8` save/load persists party, boxes, flags, blackout checkpoints, inventory, owned/seen species, and species encounter counts; legacy saves that predate persisted play-time fields now default those values during decode so `Continue` still opens. | Add general item use, PC deposit/withdraw/release/change-box flows, hidden items, and broader quest-item handling. |
| Native UI and shell | `bounded` | The app has real title flow, a Game Boy field/battle shell, native sidebars for trainer/Pokedex/party/bag/save/options, naming overlays, shop/healing overlays, save summary UI, Pokedex detail cards with encounter-count fields, and a dedicated evolution presentation scene threaded through the gameplay shell. | Replace current sidebar stopgaps with fuller GB-equivalent gameplay menus where needed, add PC UI, broaden accessibility/input settings, and extend the evolution presentation for cancel and non-level branches. |
| Audio and telemetry | `bounded` | Extracted music and SFX, cue arbitration, cries, save/audio/healing/shop/battle telemetry, HTTP control routes, and session-event traces already exist, and the audio manifest now covers the full 23-map M5-ready support set including `PEWTER_GYM` and `ROUTE_3`. | Expand coverage beyond the M5 support set, late-game cue hooks, richer debug surfaces, and deeper control-server test coverage. |

## Missing Or Still-Slice-Bounded Systems
- Whole-game extractor expansion beyond the current M5-ready support set, especially later towns, dungeons, and one-off progression systems.
- Trade/item evolution rules, evolution cancel flow, and other non-level evolution branches.
- Player and rival naming flows beyond the current fixed default names.
- General item-use plumbing outside marts and Pokeballs.
- PC storage management UI and actions.
- Hidden items and related discovery tooling.
- Gift Pokemon, in-game trades, fossils, and legendary encounter flows.
- Fishing, water encounters, Safari rules, and other non-grass encounter families.
- HM/TM reward plumbing and field-move gates for `Cut`, `Surf`, `Strength`, `Flash`, and later travel mechanics.
- Badge-award flows and badge-gated map progression.
- Special map mechanics such as elevators, warp panels, switches, dark caves, boulder puzzles, and other dungeon-specific rules.
- Endgame flows: late gyms, Victory Road, Elite Four, Hall of Fame, and credits.

## Zone Expansion Order
| Wave | Zones To Add Together | Why They Belong Together | New Systems That Must Exist First |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Z1` | `ROUTE_22`, `PEWTER_CITY`, `PEWTER_GYM`, `ROUTE_3` | This is the first post-Viridian badge loop and the smallest meaningful step beyond the current slice. | Gym-leader special battle scripting, badge awards, TM rewards, and the first non-current-slice rival special case. |
| `Z2` | `MT_MOON_*`, `ROUTE_4`, `CERULEAN_CITY`, `ROUTE_24`, `ROUTE_25`, `BILLS_HOUSE` | Mt. Moon and Cerulean are one progression arc with dense trainer coverage and early story rewards. | Cave/dungeon generalization, ladder-heavy map support, wider trainer-party extraction, gift and choice-item flows, and Bill ticket/story reward scripting. |
| `Z3` | `ROUTE_5`, `ROUTE_6`, `UNDERGROUND_PATH_*`, `VERMILION_CITY`, `S.S._ANNE_*`, `ROUTE_11`, `DIGLETTS_CAVE` access routes | This is the first HM-driven city cluster and the first large multi-map vehicle/ship story sequence. | Ticket/gate scripting, multi-floor ship progression, broader quest-item handling, HM reward plumbing, `Cut` field blockers, and more generalized town-service scripts. |
| `Z4` | `VERMILION_GYM`, `ROUTE_9`, `ROUTE_10`, `ROCK_TUNNEL_*`, `LAVENDER_TOWN` | This wave adds the next badge plus the first dark-cave traversal corridor. | Badge-gate progression, the first switch-puzzle implementation for Vermilion Gym, dark-cave or `Flash` handling, longer dungeon traversal rules, and more complete move/status coverage for the growing trainer roster. |
| `Z5` | `CELADON_CITY`, `GAME_CORNER`, `ROCKET_HIDEOUT_*` | Celadon and Rocket Hideout are tightly linked through coin economy, hideout puzzles, and Silph Scope progression. | Coin/game-corner economy, elevator/spinner/puzzle support, hideout key progression, and stronger story-item scripting. |
| `Z6` | `POKEMON_TOWER_*`, `SAFFRON_CITY`, `FIGHTING_DOJO`, `SILPH_CO_*` | The midgame Rocket arc spans Lavender and Saffron and needs the same story-item and multi-floor-office support. | Pokeflute/Silph Scope gating, gift Pokemon flows, guard/drink gate logic, multi-floor office/dungeon support, and more special-case boss trainer scripting. |
| `Z7` | `ROUTES_12_15`, `FUCHSIA_CITY`, `SAFARI_ZONE_*`, `ROUTES_16_18` | Fuchsia is the point where bike, Safari, fishing, and several new encounter systems all become mandatory. | Bike gates, fishing, water encounter tables, Safari rules, hidden items, wider item-use support, and `Strength` reward/setup work. |
| `Z8` | `SEAFOAM_ISLANDS_*`, `CINNABAR_ISLAND`, `POKEMON_MANSION_*` | This wave combines Surf-heavy travel, boulder puzzles, mansion keys, and fossil revival. | `Surf`, `Strength`, water-route traversal, dungeon puzzle mechanics, key/door puzzle state, and fossil/lab revival systems. |
| `Z9` | `VIRIDIAN_GYM`, late `ROUTE_22`, `ROUTE_23`, `VICTORY_ROAD_*`, `INDIGO_PLATEAU` | The endgame is one badge-gated corridor with late-gym, final rival, Elite Four, and ending persistence. | Full badge enforcement, late-gym scripting, Victory Road dungeon mechanics, Elite Four sequencing, Hall of Fame persistence, and credits/end-state flow. |

## Ordering Notes
- Expand the world in the order above so every new zone wave is blocked by a small, explicit set of systems instead of a vague "full parity later" bucket.
- `M7` intentionally stops short of `VERMILION_GYM`: the ship/Cut unlock can land before the first switch-puzzle implementation, so the city/harbor content and the badge fight are split on purpose.
- Do not add late-game zones before the dependency system for that zone exists in extracted content, runtime, and UI.
- When a milestone changes status, or a new dependency appears, update this file in the same change set.

## Latest Update
- `2026-03-14`: Unified gameplay screen rendering across field, battle, and evolution by introducing a shared display-style-aware screen effect, threading `FieldDisplayStyle` through battle/evolution viewports, applying the same DMG/raw treatment to the evolution scene, retuning both `Authentic DMG` and `Tinted` palettes plus shell glow/HDR to read closer to physical DMG hardware, splitting battle rendering so the shared shader only hits battlefield pixel content while the SwiftUI HUD remains outside the DMG quantization pass, and restoring the full-screen battle intro transition as a separate pass so the spiral still warps the whole screen without re-breaking HUD readability. Revalidated with focused `PokeRenderTests`/`PokeUITests` during iteration and a direct `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeMac -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData build`.
- `2026-03-14`: Landed DIM-47's level-evolution MVP by extracting source-driven evolution triggers plus dialogue/audio hooks, queuing pending evolutions off post-battle EXP rewards without breaking Transform or continuation paths, and routing a dedicated evolution scene through the native gameplay shell. Revalidated with focused `PokeExtractCLITests`, `PokeContentTests`, `PokeCoreTests/PokemonProgressionRuntimeTests`, `PokeCoreTests/AudioRuntimeTests`, and `PokeUITests/ShellAndSidebarTests`.
- `2026-03-14`: Fixed DIM-45 battle send-out drift in the native viewport by keeping the active send-out Pokemon off revision-driven implicit animation and, crucially, applying SwiftUI scale/rotation before `.position(...)` so the send-out reveal no longer scales the translated sprite toward its landing spot during `.enemySendOut`. Revalidated with `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test -only-testing:PokeUITests -only-testing:PokeCoreTests/BattleRuntimeTests`, plus a telemetry-driven native `PokeMac` wild encounter on `ROUTE_2` through the player send-out stage.
- `2026-03-14`: DIM-18 generalized extractor/content coverage beyond the original 14-map corridor so `Content/Red/` now regenerates an M5-ready support set through Pewter and `ROUTE_3` without hand edits. The generated manifests now carry 23 maps, Pewter/Viridian marts, a source-derived 97-item catalog, 16 trainer battles including Brock, expanded event flags, and 23 audio map routes. Revalidated with `./scripts/extract_red.sh` and focused `xcodebuild -workspace PokeSwift.xcworkspace -scheme PokeSwift-Workspace -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData test -only-testing:PokeExtractCLITests -only-testing:PokeContentTests`.
- `2026-03-14`: Landed GB-style trainer and player send-out presentation in the native battle viewport by threading a source-driven send-out poof asset through the content pipeline, replacing the old handcrafted burst with runtime atlas composition from extracted battle tiles, and reworking the `.enemySendOut` renderer path to use slower toss timing plus staged `3/7 -> 5/7 -> full-size` reveal beats for trainer intros and replacement send-outs without changing runtime presentation stages. Revalidated with `./scripts/extract_red.sh`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, focused `PokeUITests`, `PokeExtractCLITests`, `PokeContentTests`, and the relevant `PokeCoreTests` trainer send-out flow coverage.
- `2026-03-13`: Latest DIM-5 review rework on top of `8b68968a` fixed the last two battle-parity regressions on the move-family branch: `THRASH_PETAL_DANCE_EFFECT` now seeds the GB 2-3 continuation counter so Thrash/Petal Dance lasts 3-4 total hits before confusion, and `SWITCH_AND_TELEPORT_EFFECT` now uses the raw `enemyLevel / 4` wild-escape threshold with no artificial floor so level 1-3 opponents preserve the original zero-threshold behavior. Revalidated with focused `PokeCoreTests`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, the full `PokeSwift-Workspace` test action, `./scripts/launch_app.sh`, and native `/health` plus `/quit` telemetry probes against the built `PokeMac.app`.
- `2026-03-13`: Latest DIM-5 rework on top of `7670f0ce` fixed the two new review regressions in the battle move-family slice: incoming damage now accumulates into `bideAccumulatedDamage` while Bide is storing energy, and multi-hit attacks now share the normal Substitute damage-routing path so doll hits do not bleed through to HP or status follow-up. Revalidated with focused `PokeCoreTests`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, the full `PokeSwift-Workspace` test action, and a native `PokeMac` launch plus `/health` and `/quit` telemetry probes.
- `2026-03-13`: Final DIM-5 rework on top of `origin/main@ec558066` closed the newest review regressions in the battle move-family slice: battle presentation now burns enemy move-selection RNG while still reusing the peeked move for stable Counter ordering, copied `MIRROR_MOVE` and `METRONOME` executions now record their actual move metadata so `COUNTER` reacts to the real attack, and Transform snapshots now preserve the original Mimic slot so post-battle cleanup restores the correct move list. Revalidated with focused `PokeCoreTests`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, the full `PokeSwift-Workspace` test action, and a native `PokeMac` launch plus `/health` and `/quit` telemetry probes.
- `2026-03-13`: Closed the remaining DIM-5 battle move-family parity gap on top of the merged ledger baseline by landing GB-backed `COUNTER` behavior and adding it to the existing Pay Day, Conversion, Bide, Thrash/Petal Dance, Teleport/forced escape, trapping, charge/Fly, Transform, Substitute, Rage, Mimic, Mirror Move, and Metronome handling with battle-local cleanup on switch/end. Validated with focused `PokeCoreTests`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, the full `PokeSwift-Workspace` test action after merging `origin/main`, and a native trace-backed `PokeMac` launch.
- `2026-03-13`: Follow-up DIM-5 rework fixed the remaining review-level parity regressions in the landed move-family slice: `HAZE_EFFECT` now suppresses a cured sleep/freeze target's later move that turn, `SWITCH_AND_TELEPORT_EFFECT` now resolves success from a single RNG roll shared by text and outcome, Pay Day payouts now persist through battle input advancement, transformed Pokemon that level up in battle now keep their original-species stat/move growth after battle teardown, `COUNTER` now keys off the opponent's selected move metadata instead of copied `METRONOME`/`MIRROR_MOVE` results, and transformed learn-move prompts now surface the original move list for selection/telemetry. Revalidated with focused `PokeCoreTests`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, the full `PokeSwift-Workspace` test action, and a native `PokeMac` launch plus `/health` and `/quit` telemetry probes.
- `2026-03-13`: Latest DIM-5 review rework on top of `origin/main@ec558066` fixed three more battle-parity regressions in the landed move-family slice: charge/Fly second turns now reuse the original PP spend, zero-power fixed-damage moves now route through damage resolution and let Substitute absorb them, and battle presentation now reuses the enemy move chosen for turn ordering so GB-style Counter sequencing stays stable across RNG-consuming player actions. Revalidated with focused `PokeCoreTests`, `./scripts/build_app.sh`, the full `PokeSwift-Workspace` test action, and a native `PokeMac` launch plus `/health` and `/quit` telemetry probes.
